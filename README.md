Attempt to port the sel4 OS for the Shakti RISCV processor
This repo is a fork of the original seL4 repository for porting to RISCV architecture at https://github.com/seL4/sel4test-manifest.git .
The instructions for installation of the same can be found at https://docs.sel4.systems/Hardware/RISCV.html .
Here, we attempt to include DTS support for seL4 so that it can be ported to various hardware like the Shakti RISCV processor.
